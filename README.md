# SimpleAuth

A simple user authentication system implemented using vanilla PHP only.

## Usage

Simply clone / download this repository and run:

```bash
php -S localhost:4444

into the project folder. Now open <http://localhost:4444> in a browser.

> NOTE: I have used SQLite database to demonstrate this implementation. You have to have SQLite installed on your machine. Please visit <https://sqlite.org/download.html> to download SQLite for your machine.
